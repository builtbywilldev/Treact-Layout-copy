# Treact Grind â€“ Frontend Clone Project

This repo is part of my ongoing grind to sharpen frontend dev skills â€” pixel matching, component structure, layout discipline. Built using Treact as the foundation and training ground.

---

## ðŸ”§ Status: In Progress  
Currently have 3â€“4 sections built out.  
Hitting layout bugs, spacing issues, and component frustrations left and right.  
But still pushing. Still stacking.

---

## ðŸ§± Why Iâ€™m Doing This  
Because most people quit when it gets boring or buggy.  
Iâ€™m building reps.  
Even if itâ€™s not perfect â€” even if it never launches â€” this project is a monument to discipline.

---

## ðŸ§  What I'm Learning  
- Responsive structure using TailwindCSS  
- Reusable React components  
- Real-world debugging and layout grind  
- Pushing through friction instead of restarting

---

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps  
- Clean up mobile responsiveness  
- Build final sections  
- Polish layout flow  
- Then archive this as one more brick stacked

Built by Will.  
Forged in fire.  
Stacked in silence.
