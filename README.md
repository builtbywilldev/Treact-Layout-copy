# Treact Layout Clone – Discipline Over Hype

This isn’t a launch. It’s a lesson.  
A straight-up clone of the Treact layout — because before you invent, you imitate.  

I built this to **train my eyes, hands, and patience**. It’s not original — and that’s the point.  
This repo is my frontend dojo. Welcome to the grind.

## 🔨 What’s in the Build

- Hard-coded HTML & CSS to match layout structure  
- TailwindCSS utility flow (no magic, just margin)  
- Component repetition and responsive tweaks  
- Real-world layout pains — spacing, alignments, and "why won’t this center?" moments

## ⚔️ Why Copy?

Because doing it *once* with your own hands is worth more than watching 100 tutorials.  
I didn’t design it. I didn’t invent it.  
I *rebuilt it* — to learn how things stack, snap, and break.

## 🎯 What I’m Really Practicing

- Visual hierarchy and layout spacing  
- Tailwind muscle memory  
- Building grit when code stops cooperating  
- Debugging without crying (usually)

## 🚧 Status

- ✅ Desktop layout mostly matching  
- 🔄 Mobile needs work  
- ⛏️ Still adjusting classnames, spacing, and components  
- 🔥 Not perfect, not clean — but it’s mine

---

## 🧱 What’s Next

- Swap generic content with my own  
- Tweak structure for a future layout  
- Archive this as one more milestone in the dev journey

## 💬 Final Word

I copied this to **build discipline** — not to ship, not to sell.
